# Frank's Config Plugins

- A collection of [Expo config plugins](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/config-plugins/) for configuring the `npx expo prebuild` command.
- Along the way throughout different projects, I've come to find that there are some libraries which could be installed via config plugins (and the maintainer isn't available or isn't open to the direct idea of supporting Expo)
